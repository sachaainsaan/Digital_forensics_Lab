# Ex.No.5: Use Autopsy to Create a Case and Import Evidence


---

## Aim :
To analyze a forensic disk image using Autopsy and extract digital evidence.

---

## Requirements :
- Autopsy (installed on Windows, Linux, or macOS)  
- Forensic disk image or data source to analyze  

---

## Description :
Autopsy is an open-source digital forensics platform used for analyzing and extracting data from digital devices.  
It provides modules for file system analysis, keyword search, timeline visualization, hash analysis, and reporting.  
This experiment demonstrates how to create a case, import evidence, analyze data, and generate reports using Autopsy.
