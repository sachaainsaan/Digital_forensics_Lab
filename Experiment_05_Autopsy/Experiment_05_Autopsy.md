# Ex.No.5: Use Autopsy to Create a Case and Import Evidence
---

## Aim :
To analyze a forensic disk image using Autopsy and extract digital evidence.

---

## Requirements :
- Autopsy (installed on Windows, Linux, or macOS)  
- Forensic disk image or data source to analyze  

---

## Description :
Autopsy is an open-source digital forensics platform used for analyzing and extracting data from digital devices.  
It provides modules for file system analysis, keyword search, timeline visualization, hash analysis, and reporting.  
This experiment demonstrates how to create a case, import evidence, analyze data, and generate reports using Autopsy.

### 6. Detailed Analysis  
- **Keyword Search:**  
  - Perform searches using the Keyword Search module.  
  - Use pre-configured lists or enter custom keywords.  
- **File Analysis:**  
  - Navigate files and folders under File Types or File System.  
  - Open, view, or export files for further examination.  
- **Timeline Analysis:**  
  - Use the Timeline module to visualize events by timestamps.  
- **Hash Analysis:**  
  - Compare file hashes against known databases to identify known good/bad files.

### 7. Reporting  
- Generate a report by selecting **Generate Report** from the toolbar.  
- Choose report type (HTML, CSV, Excel, etc.).  
- Select which analysis results to include.  
- Export findings: export individual files or artifacts for reporting or further analysis.  
- Final Review: check that the report includes all relevant details.  
- Save or print the report for case documentation.
