# Ex.No.7:     Use AFLogical OSE to Extract Data from an Android Device


---

## Description :
**AFLogical OSE (Open Source Edition)** is a tool designed for logical data extraction from Android devices. As part of the Open Source Android Forensics project, it collects non-file system data like **contacts**, **messages (SMS/MMS)**, and **call logs** without needing root access.

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

1.  **Download AFLogical OSE:**
    * Visit the AFLogical OSE GitHub page and download the latest release, or clone the repository using Git.
2.  **Install Java:**
    * AFLogical OSE requires Java to run. Ensure Java is installed on your machine.
3.  **Install Android Debug Bridge (ADB):**
    * Download **ADB** (a command-line tool for device communication) from the Android Developer's website.
    * Install it on your system and **add it to your system's PATH environment variable** for easy access from the command line.
4.  **Enable USB Debugging on the Android Device:**

### 4. Transfer Extracted Data to Your Computer

1.  **Use ADB to Pull Data:**
    * After extraction is complete, transfer the collected data files from the Android device to your computer using the `adb pull` command:
        ```bash
        adb pull /sdcard/aflogical /path/to/destination
        ```

    * *Note: Replace `/path/to/destination` with the desired save location on your computer.*
2.  **Verify the Data:**
    * Navigate to the destination directory and check the `.csv` files to ensure all required data has been successfully transferred.

### 5. Analyze the Extracted Data

1.  **Open the CSV Files:**
    * Use applications like **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, or a text editor to open and analyze the `.csv` files containing the extracted logical data.
2.  **Review and Document:**
    * Carefully review the data for any relevant evidence or information.
    * Document all findings and prepare a comprehensive report.
